            <h2>"In 2025, I hope to become a Developer."</h2>
            <p>In 2025, I aspire to become a professional web developer with a strong foundation in the MERN Stack  MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I am currently focused on mastering front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gradually expanding my skills in back-end development. My goal is to build modern, dynamic, and full-stack web applications that solve real-world problems. <br>

            As I continue learning every day, I’m excited about the journey ahead  from writing clean, responsive code to deploying powerful applications using the MERN Stack. I believe 2025 will be the year I turn my passion into a profession.</p>

Designing beautiful, responsive websites using HTML and CSS, and adding dynamic functionality with JavaScript gives me a sense of accomplishment.It’s a constantly evolving field, which means I’ll always have something new to learn and that’s what keeps me motivated. My long-term goal is to become a MERN Stack Developer and create full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
